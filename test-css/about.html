  <h3>What is cat <i>Neighborhood</i>?</h3>
  <p class="class1">
    Our neighborhood was never the same after the mysterious disappearance of Whiskers — the friendliest orange tabby on the block. 
    Known for sunbathing on everyone's porch, Whiskers was loved by all. His vanishing brought together cat lovers, dog lovers, and even pigeon watchers.
  </p>

  <p class="class1">
    Lily, a 10-year-old aspiring detective, led the search party. With an umbrella in one hand and a flashlight in the other, she knocked on every door, 
    posting hand-drawn flyers and organizing evening patrols with her cat-themed walkie-talkies.

  <h2>Chapter 2: A Faint Meow</h2>
  <p class="class1">
    Just as the sun began to set on the third day, a faint meow echoed from the old tool shed behind Mr. Shrestha’s house. Everyone paused.
    Could it be? Lily slowly opened the creaky wooden door... and there he was — covered in dust, but alive and well.
  </p>

  <p class="class1">
    Whiskers had simply gotten locked in while chasing a suspicious squirrel. The mystery was solved, the neighborhood cheered, and Lily was crowned the official "Cat Hero of the Year."
